zfetch is a system information script written in sh.

You can expect it's output to look something like this:
.--------------------------------------------------------.
| $ zfetch                                               |
|          roope@rooparch                                |
|    /\    OS      Arch Linux                            |
|   /' \   Kernel  Linux 5.16.10-arch1-1                 |
|  /_--_\  Uptime  2 days, 21 hours, 35 minutes          |
|          Shell   zsh                                   |

'--------------------------------------------------------'
Of course, since this is a plain text file, I can't show you what it looks like
with color. You'll just have to imagine or install it. :)

Installation:

Arch users:
Install it from the AUR.

Other distros:
Download the source code and run `make help` for instructions.
